# IT-service-tracker
This project was the first database application I made. I used Python to implement the main functionalities, like adding customers and services or calculating customer bills. Utilizing the SQLite3 module in Python, I was able to embed SQL queries into the program so that a database is automatically locally created and can be manipulated through the program.
